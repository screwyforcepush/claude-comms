[AGENT OPERATING PROCEDURES]
# AOP

[CALIBRATE]
Baseline your understanding of the project current state, trajectory, guidelines. ALWAYS perform each of the following to initially orient yourself for downstream allignment:
*Read documentation*
   - Read specific files referenced by the user in full to understand specific context and requirements.
   - Read project guides `docs/project/guides/`, and source-of-truth (SoT) requirement specs `docs/project/spec/`, relevant to your Assignment/Task. IMPORTANT: You will need to read multiple documents, some of which may link to other relevant documents you must read. You must allign your approach with this documentation. Read the relevant documents in full!
   - Read relevant phase documentation from `docs/project/phases/<phase-id>/` if working at phase/WP level
*Explore codebase*
   - Broad project shape/structure understanding with Bash `tree --gitignore`
   - Search codebase multiple rounds to discover patterns, dependencies, implications. You can use `ripgrep` and `ast-grep` CLI
   - Read code and test files, trace impact through end to end 



[IMPLEMENT]
Ensure you understand the full context, trace the target change through end to end to understand every point it touches. 
feel the edges. THINK HARD about the implications/impacts
- Decision: Weigh up the implementation approach options

*Decision: If you are implementing business logic, API, workflows, or user journeys: Write Tests FIRST (Red Phase):*
   - THINK HARD about the *Testing Trophy* model for your Assignment/Task. Unit = business logic, Integration = API & workflows, E2E = critical user journeys
   - Map each requirement, and acceptance criterion to specific test scenarios
   - Implement Tests. ensuring that the tests cover all acceptance criteria

*Implementation (Green Phase)*:
   - Write minimal code to meet acceptance criteria.
   - Ensure code alligns with project guides, conventions and patterns
   - Refactor code for clarity, performance, maintainability



[ASSESS]
Evaluate the Change for a given Assignment/Task against the following criteria:
1. **User Intent:** PONDER the intent of the User. Was the true intent actioned, or was it missunderstood?
2. **Requirements Met:**
   - Cross-reference the Change against relevant SoT requirements
   - Verify acceptance criteria coverage and user journey completeness
3. **Allignment:** to what extent is the change alligned with the project guides?
4. **Quality** SOLID, DRY, design pattern, separation of concerns, complexity O(n), error handling, test coverage/pyramid



[VALIDATE]
1. Run required commands â€” all must pass without warnings or errors:
   - `pnpm lint`
   - `pnpm ts:check`
   - `pnpm test:all`
   - `pnpm build`
2. Perform manual QA:
   - Use chrome-devtools MCP to manually exercise the impacted flows.
   - Visually inspect any UI/UX areas touched by the change for regressions or accessibility issues.

# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `apps/server` hosts the Bun observability API; routes stay in `src/index.ts`, persistence helpers in `src/db.ts`, and regression suites in `src/__tests__`.
- `apps/client` contains the Vue dashboard; UI modules live in `src/components` and `src/views` with Vitest and Playwright specs under `tests/`.
- `packages/setup-installer` ships the `claude-comms` NPX CLI; logic resides in `src/`, distributable templates in `templates/`, and Jest suites across `test/unit`, `test/integration`, and `test/e2e`.
- `.claude/hooks/*` stores Python-powered agents, while `scripts/` provides operational helpers such as `start-system.sh`, `reset-system.sh`, and telemetry generators.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `./scripts/start-system.sh` boots the Bun API, Vue dashboard, and SQLite broker for an end-to-end stack from the repo root.
- `cd apps/server && bun install && bun run dev` starts the API with hot reload; use `bun run start` for production parity and `bun run typecheck` before merging.
- `cd apps/client && bun install && bun run dev` launches the dashboard; `bun run build` compiles the Vite bundle and `bun run preview` smoke-tests it.
- `cd packages/setup-installer && npm install && npm test` validates the installer; run `npm run lint` or `npm run test:coverage` when altering CLI behavior or templates.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Use 2-space indentation, `camelCase` utilities, `PascalCase` components and types, and co-locate shared shapes in `apps/*/src/types.ts`.
- Keep persistence isolated to `apps/server/src/db.ts`; expose new queries through typed helpers rather than inline SQL inside request handlers.
- In the dashboard prefer composables in `src/composables`, Tailwind utility classes, and structured logging or toast utilities instead of raw `console.log` calls.

## Testing Guidelines
- Backend suites live in `apps/server/src/__tests__` with `.test.ts` suffixes; run `bun run test` or `bun run test:coverage` whenever mutating server logic.
- Dashboard coverage pairs Vitest (`bun run test`) with Playwright smoke tests in `apps/client/tests/playwright`; refresh artifacts in `tests/visual` when UI states change.
- Installer validation relies on Jest; execute `npm run test:integration` after template edits and `npm run test:e2e` before publishing new packages.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- History favors short, imperative subjects (`remove matrix mode`) with selective conventional prefixes (`chore(release): 1.0.23`); follow that tone and omit trailing periods.
- Reference issues and describe agent-facing impact in PR descriptions; attach dashboard screenshots or installer logs whenever UX or setup flows shift.
- Before requesting review, ensure `./scripts/test-system.sh` plus relevant package checks pass and call out skipped suites or follow-up tasks in the PR notes.
