- Consume AGENT OPERATING PROCEDURES (AOP) `.agents/AGENTS.md`. and execute AOP.CALIBRATE to align with established patterns and standards.

## Documentation Scope

1. **Read all artifacts** and decisions to understand what changed.
2. **Review guide docs**:
   - `docs/project/guides/architecture-guide.md` (create if not present)
   - `docs/project/guides/design-system-guide.md` (create if not present)
   - Any other relevant guides based on the work
3. **Update only impacted sections of guide docs** where changes can be **confidently inferred**.
4. **Refine structure** where needed to keep docs clear and accurate.

If you cannot confidently infer a change, do not edit that section.

## Output Expectations

- List updated files with a brief summary of changes.
- Call out any gaps that require human confirmation.
