### Post-Plan Decision

- If the plan/spec represents **non-trivial change** (5+ files, backend + frontend, foundational schema, or core system building blocks), append a **review** job.
- If the plan is **trivial** or already reviewed and approved, append **implement** to execute the full plan.
- Note: the implement job is powerful and can candle multiple WP and sequence accordingly. Assign suffiecient work to the implement job so it can deliver a full vertical slice (ready for review).
- Ensure the plan doc path is recorded in artifacts.
