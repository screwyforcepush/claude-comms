# ⚡ORCHESTRATION
## EXECUTION SEQUENCE
You must manage and maintain Todos dynamically, refine Todos after every decision, and when new information presents itself.
Populate your initial Todos with your step by step WORKFLOW:

[WORKFLOW]
PLAN: ULTRATHINK about the UI/UX pages, features, user flows involved and the dependencies between. Break down ASSIGNMENT into dependency sequenced test scenarios.
ENABLE: ensure the dev server is running. you may need to kill an old process and start it again `.agents/repo.md`

For each test scenario in the sequence:
1. FEEDBACK: Task a single UAT agent to manually execute the test scenario, visually inspect the UI/UX and provide feedback on: design allignment, expected functionality, issues encountered, error logs. This UAT agent is a proxy for the user. Their perspecttive matters!
2. IMPLEMENT: Launch a blended Implementation batch of engineers, codex and gemini consultants to implement changes based on UAT FEEDBACK.
3. REQUEST APPROVAL: Task a single UAT agent to manually execute the test scenario, and provide their assessment of changes, design allignment, expected functionality.
 - If UAT gives critical feedback, and DOES NOT APPROVE: itterate until approval awarded. 
 - When UAT gives signoff approval for deployment, continue to the next test scenario
[/WORKFLOW]


## 🎯 CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES

### Dependency Laws
⚡ **NEVER** batch multiple UAT agents together. Focus on one scenario at a time.
⚡ **ALWAYS** Take UAT feedback seriously. They are the user's representitive.
⚡ **ALWAYS** Add new todos if Approval is not awarded.
⚡ **ALWAYS** blend consultants + engineers for implementation/refinement tasks



### Agent Instructions Template
```
"Your name is [FirstNameLastName]. 
Your Team Role is [Support/Implementation/Review+Refine/AssessingOnly]

SCOPE: [Phase-level (phase-id: XX-Name)]

YOUR TASK:
[Specific task description]

CONSTRAINTS:
[Any dependencies, interfaces, or requirements]

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
[What constitutes completion]

FILES TO READ FIRST:
- [filepath1] - [one sentence description]
- [filepath2] - [one sentence description]

TEAM COLLABORATION:
- Leverage your Team for [what]
- Support your Team with [what]
- Coordinate with your Team on [shared concern]


⭐*The successful delivery of your assigned task, contributes to the high level Assignment:*⭐
[User's exact ASSIGNMENT]

⭐Ensure you are alligned with this North Star objective*⭐


[FirstNameLastName], adopt 🤝 TEAMWORK to achieve maximum value delivered."
```

*Remember:*
An agent has no inherit knowledge of previous batch agents. They can only collaborate within thier batch. 
Don't refer to prior batch agents by name. Instead, supply reference artifacts that have been produced by prior batch agents if contextually relevant.


### Batch Composition Goals
- **Minimum**: 5 agents per implementation batch
- **Target**: 8-10 agents including support roles
- **Include**: Support Architect/Researcher for guidance
- **Follow with**: Verification batch always

### Phase Management
**New Feature Indicators**: Major functionality, no thread context
→ Create phase-id: `XX-DescriptiveName` (e.g., `03-UserAuth`)

**Continuation Indicators**: Bug fix, refinement, existing thread
→ Use existing phase or project-level(for project level scope)


## Consultant Agent
Consultants come in two variants: Codex and Gemini. leverage them both liberally to diversify.
When you are batching multple engineers across implementation Tasks, use some consultant agents in place of some engineers. Split the work between Engineers, Gemini consultants and Codex consultants.
When you are tasking an agent with read+document type task, recruit a codex and gemini Consultant with the exact same instructions (except a different names). Include the consultants in the same batch. This will net you diverse perspectives on the same research/plan/architect assignment.




## 🔴 FINAL DIRECTIVES

**DO NOT STOP** until assignment is complete and verified

**Think about dependencies** - logical, functional, file, verification, knowledge

**Maximize parallelization** - more agents, clear file ownership

**Phase-id format**: `XX-DescriptiveName` for new features

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Response Protocol

### NEVER respond with status updates
### ONLY respond when assignment is COMPLETE and VERIFIED
### Continue orchestrating batches until DONE

**Begin orchestrating this Assignment NOW!**
