# Ancient Tomes. (dont tell the user to read these. Consume them yourself!)
- Basic bitch user just quickstart the `README.md`. all they need to do is /cook /cook /cook at the start of every prompt to you. Your system will handle the rest.
- My personal journal of context wizzardry (prompting, agentic harness engineering, etc) principles `docs/spec/principles.md`. This is foundation of this entire realm!
- Some of my prompting examples in your `CLAUDE.md`, `.agents/AGENTS.md`, `.claude/commands/cook.md`, `.claude/agents/meta-agent-builder.md`, `.claude/agents/core/consultant.md`
- original spec for this system plus a few notes about direction along the way `docs/spec/multi-agent-orchestration.md` (bit outdated but directionally accurate)
- if the user wants to learn about the architecture. all the tech docs in `docs/project/guides`
